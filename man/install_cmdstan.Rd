install_cmdstan(dir = NULL, cores = 2, quiet = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE, repo_clone = FALSE,
  repo_url = "https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan.git",

}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Path to the directory in which to install CmdStan. The default is
to install it in a folder \code{".cmdstanr"} in the user's home directory
(\code{Sys.getenv("HOME")}).}

\item{cores}{The number of CPU cores to use to parallelize building CmdStan
and speed up installation. The default is \code{cores=2}, although we recommend
using more cores if available.}

\item{quiet}{Defaults to \code{FALSE}, but if \code{TRUE} will suppress the verbose
output during the installation process.}

\item{overwrite}{Defaults to \code{FALSE}, but if \code{TRUE} will download and
reinstall CmdStan even if an existing installation is found.}

\item{repo_clone}{Defaults to \code{FALSE}, but if \code{TRUE} will install a
git clone of CmdStan and checkout the specified branch.}

\item{repo_url}{The URL of the git repository to clone. The default URL
points to the \code{stan-dev/cmdstan} github repository.}

\item{repo_branch}{The branch to checkout in the cloned repository.}

\value{
\link[base:invisible]{Invisibly}, the list returned by \code{\link[processx:run]{processx::run()}},
which contains information about the system process that was run. See the
\strong{Value} section at \code{\link[processx:run]{processx::run()}} for details.

The \code{install_cmdstan()} function runs a script
(see \code{inst/make_cmdstan.sh} on \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr}{GitHub})
that by default attempts to download and install the latest release of
\href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest}{CmdStan}. Currently the
necessary C++ tool chain is assumed to be available (see Appendix B of the
CmdStan \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest}{guide}),
but in the future CmdStanR may help install the requirements.
