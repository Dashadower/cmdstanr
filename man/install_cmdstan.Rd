The \code{install_cmdstan()} function runs a script
(see \code{inst/make_cmdstan.sh} on \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr}{GitHub})
that attempts to download and install the latest release of
\href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases}{CmdStan}. Currently the
necessary C++ tool chain is assumed to be available (see Appendix B of the
CmdStan \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases}{manual}),
but in the future CmdStanR may help install the requirements.
