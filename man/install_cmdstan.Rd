\usage{
install_cmdstan(
  dir = NULL,
  cores = getOption("mc.cores", 2),
  quiet = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  timeout = 1200,
  release_url = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Path to the directory in which to install CmdStan. The default is
to install it in a directory called \code{.cmdstanr} within the user's home
directory (i.e, \code{file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".cmdstanr")}).}

\item{cores}{The number of CPU cores to use to parallelize building CmdStan
and speed up installation. If \code{cores} is not specified then the default is
to look for the option \code{"mc.cores"}, which can be set for an entire \R session
by \code{options(mc.cores=value)}. If the \code{"mc.cores"} option has not been set then
the default is \code{2}.}

\item{quiet}{Should the verbose output from the system processes be
suppressed when building the CmdStan binaries? The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{overwrite}{When an existing installation is found in \code{dir}, should
CmdStan still be downloaded and reinstalled? The default is \code{FALSE}, in
which case an informative error is thrown instead of overwriting the user's
installation.}

\item{timeout}{Timeout (in seconds) for the CmdStan build stage of the
installation process. The default is \code{timeout=600} (10 minutes).}

\item{release_url}{Specifies the URL to a specific Cmdstan release to be installed.
By default set to NULL, which downloads the latest stable release from stan-dev/cmdstan.}

The \code{install_cmdstan()} function attempts to download and install the latest
release of \href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest}{CmdStan} or
a development version from a repository. Currently the necessary C++ tool
chain is assumed to be available (see Appendix B of the CmdStan
\href{https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan/releases/latest}{guide}), but in the
future CmdStanR may help install the requirements.
