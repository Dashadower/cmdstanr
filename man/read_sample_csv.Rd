\title{Read CmdStan CSV files into \R}
\usage{
read_sample_csv(files, variables = NULL, sampler_diagnostics = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{A character vector of paths to the CSV files to read.}

\item{variables}{Optionally, a character vector naming the variables (parameters
and generated quantities) to read in.
\itemize{
\item If \code{NULL} (the default) then the draws of all variables are included.
\item If an empty string (\code{variables=""}) then none are included.
\item For non-scalar variables all elements or specific elements can be selected:
\itemize{
\item \code{variables = "theta"} selects all elements of \code{theta};
\item \code{variables = c("theta[1]", "theta[3]")} selects only the 1st and 3rd elements.
}
}}

\item{sampler_diagnostics}{Works the same way as \code{variables} but for sampler
diagnostic variables (e.g., \code{"treedepth__"}, \code{"accept_stat__"}, etc.).}
}
\value{
A named list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{metadata}: A list of the meta information of the sampler run.
\item \code{inv_metric}: A list (one element per chain) of inverse mass matrices
or their diagonals, depending on the type of metric used.
\item \code{step_size}: A list (one element per chain) of the step sizes used.
\item \code{warmup_draws}:  If \code{save_warmup} was \code{TRUE} then the warmup samples (iter
x chain x variable array).
\item \code{post_warmup_draws}: The post-warmup draws (iter x chain x variable array).
\item \code{warmup_sampler_diagnostics}:  If \code{save_warmup} was \code{TRUE} then warmup
draws of the sampler diagnostic variables (iter x chain x variable array).
\item \code{sampler_diagnostics}: The post-warmup draws of the sampler diagnostic
variables (iter x chain x variable array).
