\pkg{CmdStanR}: the \R interface to CmdStan.
}
\details{
CmdStanR (\pkg{cmdstanr} package) is a lightweight interface to Stan
(\href{https://mc-stan.org}{mc-stan.org}) for \R users. It provides the
necessary objects and functions to compile a Stan program and run Stan's
algorithms from \R via CmdStan, the shell interface to Stan
(\href{https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan}{mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan}).
}
\section{Getting started}{
 CmdStanR requires a working version of CmdStan. If
you already have CmdStan installed see \code{\link[=cmdstan_model]{cmdstan_model()}} to get
started, otherwise see \code{\link[=install_cmdstan]{install_cmdstan()}} for help with installation.
}

\section{Comparison with RStan}{
 The RStan interface (\pkg{rstan} package) is
an in-memory interface to Stan and relies on \R packages like \pkg{Rcpp}
and \pkg{inline} to call C++ code from R. On the other hand, the \R code in
this package does not directly call any C++ code, instead relying on
CmdStan for compilation, running algorithms, and writing results to output
files. Both forms of interfacing with Stan have advantages and
disadvantages. An in-memory interface like RStan is able to offer more
advanced features than CmdStanR (for example RStan's \code{grad_log_prob} and
\code{unconstrain_pars} methods) but keeping up with Stan releases is more
complicated for RStan, often requiring non-trivial changes to the
\pkg{rstan} package and always requiring new CRAN releases of \pkg{rstan}
and \pkg{StanHeaders}. With CmdStanR, the latest features in Stan will be
available from \R immediately after updating CmdStan, which can be done
with the \code{\link[=install_cmdstan]{install_cmdstan()}} function.

The licenses of CmdStanR (BSD-3) and RStan (GPL-3) are also different.
