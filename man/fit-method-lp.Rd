\title{Extract log probability (target)}
\description{
The \verb{$lp()} method extracts \code{lp__}, the total log probability
(\code{target}) accumulated in the \code{model} block of a Stan program. For
variational inference the log density of the variational approximation to
the posterior is also available via the \verb{$lp_approx()} method.

See the \href{https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_23/reference-manual/sampling-statements-section.html}{Log Probability Increment vs. Sampling Statement}
section of the Stan Reference Manual for details on when normalizing
constants are dropped from log probability calculations.
}
\section{Usage}{
\preformatted{$lp()
$lp_approx()
}
}

\section{Value}{

A numeric vector with length equal to the number of draws for MCMC and
variational inference, and length equal to \code{1} for optimization.
