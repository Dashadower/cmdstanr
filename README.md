# CmdStanR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CmdStanR is a lightweight interface to Stan for R users which
provides the necessary objects and functions to compile a Stan program
and run Stan's samplers via CmdStan. 

**NOTES**

* Still very early in development
* Probably doesn't work on Windows (yet)
* Requires a working version of CmdStan (doesn't yet help you install that) 
* See github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy for the Python version of this package, 
  which is already much more developed.


### Licensing

What are we allowed to use for CmdStanR??
